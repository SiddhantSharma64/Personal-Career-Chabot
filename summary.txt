Currently a 4th-year B.Tech student at OP Jindal University, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, I am deeply passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights through innovative solutions in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
With hands-on experience in end-to-end project development, I’ve built a solid foundation in MLOps, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. My projects have given me the opportunity to work across the data pipeline—from data collection and cleaning to model deployment—allowing me to develop a robust understanding of statistical modeling, regression, clustering, and real-time data-driven insights.
My technical toolkit includes proficiency in Python, complemented by visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, empowering me to communicate complex patterns and trends effectively. Additionally, my focus on continuous learning keeps me at the forefront of AI advancements and best practices.
I’m eager to apply my skills in a dynamic, real-world environment where I can contribute to impactful data-driven decision-making. Open to entry-level roles in data science and AI, I look forward to collaborating with like-minded professionals to drive innovation and uncover meaningful insights. Let’s connect and explore how we can harness data for transformative results!
